# mp3er
A very simple web-based MP3 player that showcases some of the potential of the GSAP JavaScript library. I will most likely be turning this into something bigger in the future.

## Why This Was Developed
I actually developed this project during a lesson in my Web Programming I class that I took in the Spring of 2016. I thought it was a neat little project my professor worked us through, and I just <em>now</em> put it in its own GitHub repository. I hope you think it's as interesting as I do!
